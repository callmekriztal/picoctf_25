Challenge: SSTI1 (Web Exploitation)

📝 Description
The web page contains a template injection vulnerability.  
Input from users is rendered unsafely on the page.  
Goal: exploit SSTI to retrieve the flag.

🔎 Approach / Thought Process
1. Observed that the page reflects user input directly.  
2. Tested for template injection using simple payloads:
   - `{{6*6}}` → page showed `36`  
   Heence confirmed sst1 vulnerability  
3. Used Jinja2 template injection techniques to read files.  
   - On many CTF SSTI challenges, flag is stored in `/flag` or `/home/ctf/flag.txt`.

💻 Exploitation Steps
1. Payload to read flag:  
2. Input payload in vulnerable field.  
3. Page displays the flag: `picoCTF{ssti_flag_example}`

🏁 Flag
`picoCTF{ssti_flag_example}`

⚡ Notes / References
- Tested basic arithmetic injection first to confirm vulnerability.  
- Used Jinja2 template syntax since the server is Python-based.  
- For other SSTI challenges, payload may vary depending on server language/framework.
